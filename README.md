# Neural-Indexing-EntityNormalization

This repository is an example work of how can we do Entity Normalization with Semantic Embedding using Siamese-BERT model. The original motivation is to map entity mentions to a well-known entites in reference dataset. However, the scope of this works only consider how to normalize a given text/query to the reference entity as shown below.
